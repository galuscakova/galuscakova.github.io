Apart from the documents selected using this model, the collection also contains randomly selected documents from the Qwant index. All the data were collected over June 2022. In total, the collection contains 672 train queries, with corresponding 9656 assessments coming from the Qwant click model, and 98 heldout queries. The set of documents consist of 1,570,734 downloaded, cleaned and filtered Web Pages. Apart from their original French versions, the collection also contains translations of the webpages and queries into English. The collection serves as the official training collection for the 2023 [LongEval Information Retrieval Lab](https://clef-longeval.github.io/) organised at CLEF.
