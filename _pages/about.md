I am an associate professor in Natural Language Processing at the [University of Stavanger](https://www.uis.no/en), where I am part of the [Information Access & Artificial Intelligence (IAI) research group](https://iai.group/). Previously, I was a researcher at the [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and a member of [Modélisation et Recherche d’Information Multimédia](https://www.liglab.fr/fr/recherche/equipes-recherche/mrim) team, working with [Philippe Mulhem](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/mulhem/) and [Lorraine Goeuriot](http://mrim.imag.fr/User/lorraine.goeuriot/). Before that, I was a postdoc at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu) working with [Doug Oard](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~oard/). I was a member of [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/) and the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/) there. I completed my PhD in computational linguistics at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/) at [Charles University in Prague](https://cuni.cz/) where I was advised by [Pavel Pecina](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~pecina/index.html). 

I have been working on a wide range of information retrieval and natural language processing problems and I particularly enjoy working on interdisciplinary research and applications. My main research focus is cross-language information retrieval and multimedia, speech and video retrieval.
